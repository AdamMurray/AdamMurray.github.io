Welcome to the nuts and bolts of my weird wee site! --> [adambreathes.tech/](http://adambreathes.tech/)

It's probably about time that I stopped bothered about this repo being private, and today (05/07/2018) is that day.
So here it is, in all its boring non-glory.

When I started the site I wanted to make one of those super-polished, fancy-ass portfolio sites. But then I realised that that's not really me. So I made something that sort of looks like the splash screen of a shit video game. And that definitely is me. So that's that explained.

Eventually I'm going to use a proper modern framework and make it all cool. But for now it's a bit old school, and I'm happy about that.
